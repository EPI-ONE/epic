Epic is a pow chain that achieves an order of magnitude improvement on the throughput without sacrificing the security and decentralization.

We have released our `testnet 0.1.0`. You may join the testnet by following the [instruction](#compile-and-run).

## Design

The design of the consensus mechanism is based on a Structured DAG. Refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02755) for details.

## Implementation

The implementation of this peoject is written in C++ 17.

- C/C++ compilier and library
    - `gcc` version 8 or up on Linux
    - Apple LLVM version 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8) provided by XCode 11 on OS X 10.15

- `cmake` version 3.15 or up

- (Recommended) `clang` version 8 or up as an alternative (or better) compiler.
  Note: the llvm `libc++` lacks support of some C++ 17, thus still need the `gcc` (or Mac clang) library.

Builds on several existing projects:

- Our source code has included the code from existing projects:
    - several pieces of code in the [bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) project, some of which with our own modification.
    - `cxxopts` [v2.0.0](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts)
    - `cpptoml` [v0.1.1](https://github.com/skystrife/cpptoml)
    - `spdlog` [v1.3.1](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) 
- The following dependencies need to be installed on your system:
    - `openssl` [version 1.1](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
    - `libsecp256k1`
    - `libevent` [version 2.1.11](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases)
    - `RocksDB` [version 6.1.2](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) or up
    - `protobuf` [version 3.10.0](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) 
    - `gRPC` [version 1.23.0](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) or up
    - `GoogleTest` [version 1.10.0](https://github.com/google/googletest)

We test this project on Ubuntu (18.04), CentOS (7.6) and MacOS X (10.14.6). See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## Compile and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epi-one/epic/
cd epic && mkdir build && cd build
# Debug mode by default
# cmake ..
# Release mode
cmake -DCAMKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
cd ../bin
# you may run the following test
./epictest
# runing the daemon
./epic --configpath /path/to/toml
# send rpc command to daemon
./epic-cli [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

We provide a default [config.toml](./config.toml), where seed address for the testnet is provided. You may customize a number of things, e.g., how to use spdlog, by editing it.

### GPU mining

The project is enabled with CPU mining by default, if no CUDA installation found on the system.
It compiles the CUDA code with NVCC if CUDA is found, and GPU mining is then enabled automatically.
To disable GPU mining at all, add the flag `-DEPIC_ENABLE_CUDA=OFF` to the `cmake` command before compiling the codes.

If you are experiencing the following runtime error: `GPUassert(2): out of memory <EPIC PATH>/src/miner.h 32` while you do have adequate GPU memory, set the following shell environment variable:


``` shell
$ export ASAN_OPTIONS="protect_shadow_gap=0"
```
