### Installing Dependencies

#### google test v1.8.1

   Refer to link: https://github.com/google/googletest
#### spdlog v1.3.1
   - We only use header file and you can refer to it via https://github.com/gabime/spdlog
   - You should create your own config.toml and put it in the bin dir, if you don't create config.toml, the program will use the default_config.toml
#### libevent
   We specify the libevent version 2.1.8 for building a stable base network. You need to download the source code and compile it.  https://github.com/libevent/libevent/archive/release-2.1.8-stable.zip

 ```shell
  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make install
 ```
#### libsecp256k1
   This is a stand-alone library in the bitcoin-core project. Please clone the source code and compile it.

  ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git
   $ cd secp256k1
   $ ./autogen.sh
   $ ./configure --enable-module-recovery=yes
   $ make
   $ ./tests
   $ sudo make install
  ```
   Please note that on *Mac OSX* you will have to install `gmp` via brew as `libsecp256k1` depends on it.
   ```
   brew install gmp
   ```

#### rocksdb
* For MacOS, it's as simple as `brew install rocksdb`.
* For Linux, please refer to the link https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md

#### gRPC and protobuf

```shell
   $ git clone -b $(curl -L https://grpc.io/release) https://github.com/grpc/grpc
   $ cd grpc
   $ git submodule update --init
   $ make
   $ sudo make install
   $ cd third_party/protobuf
   $ sudo make install
```

### Building the Project

```shell
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ cd ..
    $ ./bin/epictest           # Run unit tests
    $ ./bin/epic [FLAGS]       # Run daemon
    $ ./bin/epicc [COMMAND]    # Send RPC commands to daemon
```
#### GPU mining

   The project is enabled with CPU mining by default, if no CUDA installation found on the system.
   It compiles the CUDA code with NVCC if CUDA is found, and GPU mining is then enabled automatically.
   To disable GPU mining at all, add the flag `-DEPIC_ENABLE_CUDA=OFF` to the `cmake` command before compiling the codes.

   If you are experiencing the following runtime error: `GPUassert(2): out of memory <EPIC PATH>/src/miner.h 32` while you do have adequate GPU memory, set the following shell environment variable:


``` shell
    $ export ASAN_OPTIONS="protect_shadow_gap=0"
```
